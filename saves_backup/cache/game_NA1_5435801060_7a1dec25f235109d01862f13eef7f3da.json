  "draft_analysis": "**Draft & Win Condition**\n\n- **Enemy comp**: Frontline bruisers (Aatrox, Udyr) + heavy AoE magic damage (Rumble) + hypercarry (Vayne) + enchanter peel/poke (Karma). This is a classic **bruiser frontline + hypercarry + enchanter** team that scales and teamfights extremely well.\n- **Your comp**: Urgot + Rammus + Yone + Jhin + Blitz = **pick + short-range DPS** with decent engage but very little peel and limited waveclear from mid. You need to **snowball skirmishes and control vision for picks** before Vayne/Aatrox scale.\n- On paper, enemy has the edge: they win **front-to-back fights**, outscale in sidelane (Aatrox vs Urgot/Yone) and in DPS (Vayne vs Jhin), and Karma/Rumble punish your short range when you walk into rivers/chokes.",
  "pick_quality": "**Pick Critique (Yone Mid)**\n\n- Into **Aatrox + Udyr + Rumble + Karma + Vayne**, Yone\u2019s issues: likes long all-ins but enemy has strong **disengage (Karma), anti-melee zones (Rumble R), and tanky frontliners** you can\u2019t burst early. You also add another melee into Udyr/Aatrox, making fights harder.\n- From this comp, a **control mage or long-range mid** (e.g. Viktor, Orianna, Syndra) would fit better: frontline damage from safety, better waveclear to protect mid tower (which fell at 14m), and reliable front-to-back scaling.\n- If your pool lacks stable control mages, **new champ to learn**: **Viktor** \u2013 safe laning, waveclear, DPS vs tanks, synergizes with Rammus/Blitz engage and Jhin follow-up.",
  "story": "**The Turning Point**\n\n- The game flipped between **11\u201320 minutes**: after a good early kill on Rumble and pick on Vayne, you died **repeatedly in side and river (11m, 13m, 16m, 18m, 20m, 21m)** trying to fight Aatrox/Udyr without setup.\n- These deaths coincided with **outer tower losses (mid 14m, top 15m, bot 18m)** and then **mid inner at 22m**, giving enemy total map control; Aatrox went 9/0/5 off these overextensions.\n- From there, your comp lost any chance to play picks: enemy grouped, walked down lanes with Baron-like map control, and you had no vision or sidelane threat to contest.",
  "ideal_build": "**Objective Best Build (This Game)**\n\nEnemy threats: heavy healing (Aatrox, Udyr, Vayne), mixed damage with strong frontliners.\n\n- **Core**\n  - Berserker's Greaves\n  - Blade of the Ruined King (strong vs Aatrox/Udyr/Vayne, dueling + HP shred)\n  - Immortal Shieldbow (anti-burst + lifesteal vs AoE Rumble + Vayne crit)\n- **Mid game / situational**\n  - Wit's End (MR + on-hit DPS vs Rumble + Karma poke, helps vs Udyr if AP stance)\n  - Death\u2019s Dance (physical mitigation & heal on takedown vs Aatrox/Udyr focus)\n- **Flex 6th** (depending on game state)\n  - Guardian Angel (if getting one-shot / need last-fight insurance)\n  - Mortal Reminder **upgrade** (only if team lacks enough anti-heal and Aatrox/Udyr/Vayne are unkillable)\n\n**Example final 6**: Berserker's Greaves, Blade of the Ruined King, Immortal Shieldbow, Wit's End, Death's Dance, Guardian Angel.",
  "build_vision": "**Build Critique**\n\n- Your build path: **Doran\u2019s Shield start \u2192 Berserker's \u2192 Blade of the Ruined King \u2192 straight Infinity Edge \u2192 very late Executioner\u2019s**.\n- Issues:\n  - **No Shieldbow**: Against Rumble + Vayne + Aatrox burst, skipping a lifeline made every misstep lethal. You were 0/3 in a row between 16\u201321m; Shieldbow would have turned some deaths into escapes or kills in skirmishes.\n  - **Early Infinity Edge is greedy**: IE is great when ahead and already crit-stacked; in this game you were behind, versus bruisers that stack damage over time. You needed **defensive DPS (Shieldbow/DD/Wit\u2019s End)**, not raw crit.\n  - **Late anti-heal**: Aatrox 9/0 and Udyr/Vayne healing heavily, yet Executioner\u2019s only at **27m**. If Rammus isn\u2019t rushing Thornmail + Jhin not rushing early Grievous, you should have **early Executioner\u2019s (after BotRK components)**.\n- Ideal adaptation: **Berserker's \u2192 BotRK \u2192 Shieldbow \u2192 Executioner\u2019s (if needed) \u2192 Wit's End / DD**. This gives you enough survivability to actually output damage in 5v5s instead of dying on first engage.",
  "mistakes": "**Critical Mistakes & Bad Habits**\n\n1) **What lost THIS game**\n- **Repeated deaths during transition to mid game (11\u201321m)**:\n  - Dying to Karma at 9m, then Udyr at 11m, then Vayne at 13m, then Aatrox twice (16m, 18m), then Udyr twice more (20m, 21m) \u2013 that\u2019s **7 deaths in 12 minutes**, directly chained to tower losses and Aatrox snowball.\n  - These were likely **side-lane or river engages without vision** or without tracking enemy jungle. Yone *must* use E + wave to poke and not snap onto full-HP bruisers without backup.\n- **Wrong fights chosen**:\n  - Your comp wants **picks with Blitz hook / Rammus taunt + Jhin follow-up**, not long front-to-back into Aatrox/Rumble zones. Your death timestamps line up with fighting on enemy terms rather than setting up picks through vision.\n\n2) **Silent Killer Habits (to fix long-term)**\n- **Poor recall + item timing discipline**:\n  - Buying items in small pieces and staying on map with awkward spikes (e.g., early Pickaxe/BF towards IE instead of finishing a defensive mythic) led to windows where you were much weaker than Aatrox/Udyr.\n- **Over-sidelaning without info**:\n  - Deaths at 16m, 18m, 20m, 21m strongly suggest **catching sidelane waves with no river/tribush vision**. As a melee assassin/fighter, you must:\n    - Only push sides when you see **at least 3 enemies** on the map.\n    - Use E conservatively to test fog and disengage, not as your first gap closer.\n- **Lack of anti-heal awareness**:\n  - Aatrox + Udyr + Vayne demand **early Grievous** from someone. Track your team\u2019s builds: if they don\u2019t buy it, you must. Delaying this until 27m is a recurring macro mistake that will cost you many games.\n- **Not respecting spike timings**:\n  - Aatrox with core + level leads will beat you even if you land a good combo. Track enemy mythic/2-item spikes and avoid dueling when you are item down.",
  "verdict": "**Final Verdict**\n\n- The loss came from drafting a short-range melee mid into a strong front-to-back comp, then doubling down with greedy damage itemization and repeated, visionless mid-game deaths that handed Aatrox and Udyr full control of the map."
