  "draft_analysis": "**Draft & Win Condition**\n\n- **Your comp**: 3 AD carries/assassins (Riven, Jayce, Twitch) + Shaco; extremely high damage, but very low **reliable engage, peel, and frontline**. You want: early\u2013mid snowball, flanks, fog-of-war picks, and fast objective bursts.\n- **Enemy comp**: Aurelion Sol + Vladimir = **insane scaling AoE magic DPS**, Amumu + Blitz = hard engage + lockdown, Jhin follows up safely. They want: 5v5 front-to-back fights and stalling to late.\n- **On paper edge**: Enemy. You lack a tank and hard engage; they have **better scaling, better teamfight tools, and easier execution**. Your win condition is to **dive and delete Aurelion/Jhin from angles** before Amumu + Blitz press R; if the game goes 30+ mins with grouped 5v5s, their comp wins almost always.",
  "pick_quality": "**Pick Critique (Champion Identity)**\n\n- **Riven viability**: Riven is fine into a squishy, immobile backline (Aurelion/Jhin) but your team already had **Jayce + Twitch + Kaisa + Shaco** = 4 damage threats, 0 front line, 0 peel. Riven adds more of the same and **does not fix the comp\u2019s structural problems** (engage or tank).\n- **Better pick from a typical fighter pool**: A tanky engager like **Malphite** (hard engage + armor vs Jhin + Aurelion stationary channeling) or **Jarvan IV** mid/top would have been far more valuable: instant access to backline, gives your squishies room to DPS.\n- **New champ to learn (cover this hole)**: **Galio mid** \u2013 provides: magic damage, waveclear, **frontline, peel, and reliable AoE engage** + anti-dive vs Amumu/Vladimir/Aurelion. Great when your team already has enough damage and needs stability.",
  "story": "**The Turning Point**\n\n- **Mid\u2013late collapse around Aurelion Sol spikes**: His 16/3/7 score + multiple kills on you at 25\u201335m (25, 28, 33, 35m) shows he became **untouchable DPS** in grouped fights. Once he hit 2\u20133 items, your poke/dive windows closed.\n- Your team traded outer/inner towers well midgame (20\u201326m), but **you lost too many inner/base turrets in return** (27\u201331m) and then both nexus turrets while repeatedly dying to Aurelion. Those deaths turned every fight into a **front-to-back Aurelion ult zone** where your comp cannot walk forward.\n- The game was decided when you **failed to transition early structural leads (multiple enemy inners down)** into vision control and clean engages on Aurelion/Jhin; instead, you fought in mid lane chokes into Amumu + Aurelion and bled kills and base turrets.",
  "ideal_build": "**Objective Best Build for This Game**\n\nAssuming Riven mid vs heavy AP (Aurelion, Vlad) with Amumu CC and no true tank on your team:\n\n- **Start**: Doran's Blade + Potion (you needed damage/pressure, not Shield)\n- **Core**:\n  - **Axiom Arc** (synergy with pick/dive, ult uptime for repeated flanks)\n  - **Ionian Boots of Lucidity** (CDR is core on Riven; you need low cooldowns to weave in/out vs Aurelion/Amumu)\n  - **Sundered Sky** (core mythic: sustain + burst + extended fight DPS)\n- **Situational 3\u20135** (this game-specific):\n  - **Maw of Malmortius** (good 3rd/4th vs triple AP threat: Aurelion, Vlad, Amumu)\n  - **Death\u2019s Dance** (vs mixed damage and burst \u2013 pairs well with Sundered for skirmish durability)\n  - **Guardian Angel** (you are primary diver into insane AoE; GA lets you bait cooldowns)\n\n**Sample final full build**:\n\n- Ionian Boots of Lucidity\n- Axiom Arc\n- Sundered Sky\n- Maw of Malmortius\n- Death\u2019s Dance\n- Guardian Angel",
  "build_vision": "**Build Critique (Why It Hurt You)**\n\n- **Early game**:\n  - Doran\u2019s **Shield** + very early Hexdrinker \u2192 ultra-defensive lane, low damage; you delay your hard spike (Caulfield\u2019s, Axiom) and can\u2019t punish Aurelion/Vlad early. Against scaling AP control mages, you must **pressure, not handshake scaling**.\n- **Mythic delay / wrong priority**:\n  - You rushed **Maw** \u2192 **Ravenous Hydra** \u2192 **Death\u2019s Dance** before any mythic. That gives sustain and some tankiness, but **no mythic passive, no ability haste spike, and lower burst** when your comp needs to delete Aurelion/Jhin fast.\n  - Hydra is fine 2nd in snowball games, but here it slowed your assassination threat and didn\u2019t help you survive Aurelion\u2019s AoE in 5v5s.\n- **Anti-heal slot usage**:\n  - Early **Executioner\u2019s \u2192 Mortal Reminder** is understandable vs Vladimir + Amumu healing, but on Riven it\u2019s a **low-efficiency DPS slot** vs Aurelion/Jhin compared to finishing core AD/CDR items first. Ideally: pick up **Executioner\u2019s** early, delay upgrade until 5th\u20136th.\n- **Boot choice**:\n  - **Mercury\u2019s Treads** are reasonable vs Amumu + Aurelion + Vlad, but given your core identity as a CDR-reliant skirmisher and the need to **one-shot carries from angles**, **Ionian Boots** have higher carry potential here. Tenacity could have been supplemented by runes (Legend: Tenacity) instead.",
  "mistakes": "**Critical Mistakes & Bad Habits**\n\n1. **What lost THIS game**\n- **Bad win-condition read**: With 3+ hyper-damage champs, your job wasn\u2019t more DPS; it was **clean dives on Aurelion/Jhin and avoiding straight front-to-back 5v5 mid**. Repeated mid-lane deaths to Aurelion (25\u201335m) gave him unlimited tempo and opened your base.\n- **Inefficient build sequencing**: Delaying mythic and early over-investment in defensive/AP-resist (Hexdrinker \u2192 Maw first) + Hydra before core meant that your **midgame spike came too late** to contest Aurelion when he took over the map.\n- **Objective/side-lane trade-offs**: You took several turrets top/mid, but allowed **too many inner/base turrets in return** and then stayed contesting mid without proper vision. You didn\u2019t translate side lane pressure into **vision lines and flanking angles**; instead you group-fought on their terms.\n\n2. **Silent Killer Habits (will hurt future climbs)**\n- **Over-grouping mid vs better teamfight comp**: Walking into mid river/lanes without clear flank plan or vision vs Amumu/Blitz/Aurelion is a long-term LP drain. As Riven, you should **live in side lanes + fog**, arriving from angles only after enemies show.\n- **Itemization autopilot**: Rushing comfort items (Hydra, Maw) without checking **team damage balance and enemy win condition** will consistently lower your impact. High-Elo Riven shifts between damage/utility/defense based on whether the enemy comp is burst, poke, or front-to-back.\n- **Late-game discipline**: After 30m vs Aurelion + Vlad, your window to 1v9 shrinks. Continuing to take coin-flip fights instead of **waiting for picks, forcing Baron setups, or trading sides** is a pattern that will repeatedly lose winnable games.",
  "verdict": "**Final Verdict**\n\n- You lost not because Riven can\u2019t carry here, but because the **draft lacked frontline, your build delayed core spikes, and you fought Aurelion\u2019s ideal 5v5 fights instead of playing for flanks and tempo side pressure.**"
