  "overview": "**The Diagnosis**.\n\n1. **Your Archetype**: The 'Isolation Skirmisher (Objective-Blind Duelist)'. You play a mix of skirmish-first mids (Yone, Riven, Jax) and pick/roam mages (Ahri, Syndra, Leblanc). Your KDA and damage numbers show you can win lanes and dish out damage \u2014 especially on Ahri and Syndra \u2014 but your kill participation (0.40) and vision score (23) are low for a mid who should be central to objectives. You show strong solo carry potential in lane or short skirmishes, but you frequently aren\u2019t converting that pressure into team-objective control or presence in teamfights.\n\n2. **The Root Cause**: A consistent identity + macro mismatch and poor objective-discipline. Symptoms (low KP, repeated \"lost tower pressure\", \"fell behind in dragon control\", \"got picked before objectives\") point to the same underlying habit: you prioritize isolated skirmishes, side pressure, or solo play over two things that win games \u2014 timely vision setup and deliberate objective presence. That leads to: getting caught before objectives, not being on the map for dragon/baron fights, giving up tower plates and map control, and sometimes overcommitting in unfavorable fights (hence the spikes of high deaths on Yone). In short: you can create local advantages, but you don't reliably translate them into map/objective advantage because your macro routine (vision, timing, TP/roam coordination, and teamfight posture) is inconsistent.\n\n3. **The 'One Big Thing'**: Fix your objective routine and vision discipline. Before every major objective window (dragon, rift herald, baron, tower dive attempt) you must have: wave state managed, at least one control ward in the area, an oracle/vision plan, and an explicit decision (commit or back) communicated with pings. Making this a reflex will immediately raise your KP, prevent the \"picked before objective\" losses, and convert your lane pressure into wins.\n",
  "champion_feedback": "### Ahri / Leblanc / Syndra (burst/pick mages)\n- Identity shift: From \"make flashy solo plays\" to \"create picks that lead into objectives.\" Your Ahri results are your best \u2014 she fits a playstyle that both roams and helps objective control if timed. Lean into that: shove, immediately place a control ward, and roam only when the bot/jungle can follow or when dragon is impossible within 30s.\n- Runes/items: Electrocute or Dark Harvest for kill pressure; take Magical Footwear + Cosmic Insight for roaming windows, and always carry a Stopwatch/Zhonya's in games where you get picked before objectives. Build path: early boot+control ward -> damage (Lich Bane/Hextech/Luden variant) -> Zhonya's vs. pick-threat teams -> Morello/Shadowflame situationally.\n- Lane -> Mid -> Late: In lane, use Q/W to keep wave in a position where you can shove level 6 and immediately look for side roam. Mid-game, stay around neutral objectives \u2014 if the jungler is on the objective, your job is flank/zone and control vision; late-game, play as the pick threat that forces opponents to facecheck into your vision or waste time clearing it.\n\n### Yone / Riven / Jax (skirmishers / duelists)\n- Identity shift: These champs want 1) cleanly won sidelane pressure and 2) controlled re-entry to objectives. Stop trying to force teamfights as primary; your value is split-push or skirmish follow-up. If you commit to dueling and take a lead, use it to take a tower or force a response that creates an objective window for your team.\n- Runes/items: Yone/Jax \u2014 Conqueror/Pressing keystone and prioritise a lifesteal/defensive mid-game spike if you're dying (early Death's Dance/Bloodthirster or a defensive Mythic/GA). Riven \u2014 standard lethality/AD spike but pick a defensive mid-game item (Sterak's/GA) when games trend toward being decided by picks.\n- Lane -> Mid -> Late: In lane, focus wave control: either slow push to draw jungle attention or freeze to deny enemy jungle access. Before you roam or attempt to dive, place/ask for vision and ensure the wave is in a favorable state so you don't lose tower plates for free. In mid/late: do not contest Baron/Dragon alone \u2014 your jobs are flank, zone, or split depending on comp.\n\n### Viktor / Lissandra (scaling & zone control)\n- Identity shift: Viktor is your scaling control tool \u2014 treat him as the \"safe objective control\" pick. Lissandra should be the engage-safety pick: use her to force picks and then convert to dragon/baron. When you play these champs, be the team's zone controller at objectives instead of trying to 1v1.\n- Runes/items: Viktor \u2014 standard AP scaling path and Morello/Shadowflame/GA; Lissandra \u2014 Zhonya's early and CDR/armor depending on enemy comp.\n- Phase coaching: Play for mid-game roams that secure dragons; you\u2019re stronger in grouped objective fights than isolated skirmishes.\n\n### Akali / Zed / Kassadin (assassins)\n- Identity shift: These are high-risk picks given your \"picked-before-objective\" pattern. Only play them when you have a strict plan to split-shove or one-shot a key target AND your team can convert map pressure into objectives. If you continue, force more pre-objective vision and frequently pick Stopwatch.\n\n### General cross-champion habits\n- Ward routine: Buy and place a control ward at 6, 12, and 18 minutes in river/side-bush; swap to Oracle when you begin to contest dragons/baron. Ping your ward timing and objective windows.\n- Communication: If you shove and roam, ping your intention and mark where you want the jungler to be for dragon. If you see enemy mid roaming, call it \u2014 many losses are because objectives were taken while you were not present.",
  "itemization_tips": "**Build Efficiency**. Observed likely static mistakes (inferred from low vision, frequent picks, and high deaths):\n\n- Vision items neglect: Your vis score (23.1) and repeated \"got picked before objective\" indicate you underbuy control wards and delay Oracle use. Make 1 control ward per back a minimum and buy Oracle when prepping multi-man objectives.\n\n- Defensive timeout: Frequent high-death games on duelists indicate missing early defensive options. If you die repeatedly on Yone/Riven, adapt by adding one defensive mid-game item (GA/Stopwatch/Sterak's/Death's Dance) before finishing full offensive build.\n\n- Stopwatch/Zhonya's discipline: On mobile mages/picks (Ahri, Lissandra, Viktor), a single Stopwatch purchase per game reduces \"picked before objective\" losses dramatically. If you get targeted pre-objective, that item equalizes many fights.\n\n- Rune-fit to role: You pick champions that either need to roam safely or require split-sustain. If you're playing skirmishers a lot, prefer runes that give sustain/survivability (Conqueror/Second Wind if you're constantly shoved/harassed) or mobility (Phase Rush) when roaming is your priority. For control mages choose keystones that let you guarantee kills or influence fights (Electrocute/Dark Harvest for picks, Aery/Arcane for consistent poke if you want safer macro).\n\n- Plate/timing itemization: When you have lane priority, buy boots + control ward and look to rotate to side lanes to take plates before dragon windows. Don't reach for expensive final items when your team is about to contest an objective\u2014buy a control ward + sweeper instead.\n",
  "goals": "**Top 5 Strategic Priorities**. Ranked, concrete, actionable habits to fix the Root Cause. No fluff.\n\n1) Objective-Vision Routine (Daily drill): Before every dragon/baron/push, ensure: a) your wave state is favorable (shoved or frozen depending on plan), b) at least one control ward in the river/tri-bush, c) either you or your jungler has Oracle. If any of those are missing, back off and fix vision\u2014do not contest.\n\n2) Kill Participation by Wave Management (Practice task): For every game, execute this: 3 times per game push a full wave under enemy tower or slow-push a wave and then immediately roam to create an objective or assist in a gank. Track KP after each game \u2014 aim to +0.1 KP within two weeks.\n\n3) 'No-Objective Alone' Rule (Hard rule): Never approach or contest a dragon/baron alone. If you are not within 10s travel time of your team to the objective when the enemy team is starting it, do not facecheck or overextend; instead, shove and rotate with vision.\n\n4) One Defensive Item / Stopwatch Threshold (Item rule): If you die more than twice in the early-mid game (first 20 minutes) on a given champion, immediately change your next build path to include a defensive/mid-game survivability item or Stopwatch/Zhonya's. This prevents repeat cycle of being picked and feeding objective control.\n\n5) Champion Pool Consolidation & Replay Habit (Weekly): Lock to 2\u20133 core champions that align with objective-play for a block of 12 games (e.g., Ahri + Viktor + one skirmisher like Yone but only as a split-push pick). After each block, review 3 losses and tag: were you present for objectives? Were you warded? Correct one repeatable mistake each week (vision placement timing, roam timing, or back/timing errors).\n\nExecute these five in order; the biggest jump comes from making vision + objective routine automatic. That will immediately raise KP, reduce \"picked before objective\" losses, and let your lane pressure convert into towers and dragons \u2014 which is the exact lever missing from your play.\n"
