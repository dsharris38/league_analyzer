  "overview": "**The Diagnosis**.\n\n1. **Your Archetype**: The \"Objective Ghost\". You show up on the scoreboard with a healthy KDA and decent farming \u2014 you don't often throw by dying in lane skirmishes \u2014 but you systematically miss or lose fights that decide the map. Your damage share and kill participation are low for a jungler who plays skirmish/utility champs, and the loss patterns repeatedly point to dragons, Baron, and tower pressure being conceded while you are absent, late, or dead. In short: you look like a safe, high-KDA jungle player who isn't reliably present or effective for objectives.\n\n2. **The Root Cause**: Macro discipline around objectives. The data points to two connected habits: poor pre-objective setup (insufficient vision, poor angle control) and predictable/slow pathing that leaves you arriving late or getting picked off before fights. The \"got_picked_before_objective\" and objective gap tags (0.875 each) are the smoking gun \u2014 you lose control because you either start objectives without clearing vision/flanks or you path in a way that gets you isolated and killed. That cascades into lost dragons/Baron, lost towers, then a team that can't safely fight or rotate.\n\n3. **The 'One Big Thing'**: Fix pre-objective discipline and presence. Make the objective fight a process (vision -> flank/wait -> engage on your terms), not a reaction. If you consistently stop getting caught before objectives and instead show up with vision and angles secured, half the loss reasons disappear (dragon/baron/tower pressure, low KP, low damage share).",
  "champion_feedback": "**Champion-Specific Adjustments**.\n\n### FiddleSticks\nIdentity shift: From 'scary ult' to 'objective controller'. You already get good KDA on Fiddle \u2014 the missing piece is turning fights around objectives rather than single kills.\n- Early (0:00\u201310:00): prioritize scuttle and mid-priority gank windows. Use early control wards at enemy jungle entrances to protect your flank.\n- Mid (10:00\u201320:00): position to zone the pit \u2014 place brambles/wards on pit ledges and hold brush that denies approach. Your fear+ult wins fights if enemies are funneled; don't facecheck the pit.\n- Late (20:00+): you should be the zone/denial tool during Baron/Dragon. If you're not certain you have flank vision, wait for an ally to clear or for enemy to commit; initiations without vision are what gets you picked.\n- Rune/item emphasis: favor pick/poke keystones (Electrocute/Dark Harvest) or utility that increases burst reliability; build items that let you control fights (early Oblivion Orb/Morello vs healing comps, Liandry for tankier teams). Always buy Control Wards and invest in sweepers.\n\n### Trundle\nIdentity shift: Split-pressure win condition that translates to objective leverage.\n- Early: path to prioritize lane ganks that grant lane priority and open tower plates. If you get lane priority, force plates or deep vision so you can take Rift Herald/dragon windows.\n- Mid: Trundle's biggest strength is converting a lead into towers. When ahead, push side lanes and threaten to take structures so the enemy must respond \u2014 that creates safe Baron/Dragon windows for your team.\n- Late: you should be the raid boss or the Baron escort. Stay alive and take objectives; avoid silly engages without team follow-up.\n- Rune/item emphasis: building a damage/tank hybrid (Sunderer/Stridebreaker + Sterak/Titanic piece depending) \u2014 pick the build that lets you either 1v1 a carry or shred the front line and secure towers.\n\n### Zyra (as utility/pick jungler)\nIdentity shift: Zyra belongs as a vision-and-pick engine, not a farm-first jungler.\n- Early: if you insist on Zyra jungle, your goal is early pressure and vision control. Your plants are pit-denial tools \u2014 use them to control scuttle and objective brushes.\n- Mid: rotate to mid/side to set up picks and secure deep control wards before objectives. Don't try to solo secure dragons; instead, provide the pick that wins the fight.\n- Late: play as off-engage/zone \u2014 you win games by preventing enemy approaches to Baron/Dragon.\n- Note: Zyra in jungle is high-variance. Consider moving Zyra to support if you want consistent objective control tools without sacrificing jungle KP.\n\n### Rammus\nIdentity shift: Rammus must be the disciplined initiator, not a reckless flanker without vision.\n- Early: path for quick ganks into lanes that have CC or are pushed. Avoid blind flanks into river brushes with no vision \u2014 that's exactly how you get caught.\n- Mid/Late: your job is to either lock down a priority target or peel carries during objective fights. If you can't commit safely to the pit, hold side vision and wait for the enemy to commit.\n- Rune/item emphasis: Aftershock + early armor items (Thornmail/Dead Man/Spirit Visage variants) to make engages stick.\n\n### Lillia\nIdentity shift: Farm-first skirmisher who times engages to target CC.\n- Early: prioritize safe clear to hit 2-item power spike; don't force early contested dragons unless you have vision control.\n- Mid: pick fights in side lanes and avoid 5v5s where your ult is useless. Use speed/ult to zone and remove priority threats during Baron/Dragon fights.\n\n### DrMundo & Misc\n- DrMundo: treat as side-lane objective magnet. If you pick Mundo, make sure to draw pressure and create Baron/Dragon windows for your team.\n- Sivir (one-off): avoid off-role jungle Sivir \u2014 play role-appropriate champions for consistent objective timelines.\n\nOverall: pick champions whose macro role you can execute. If you want to improve objective control, prioritize Fiddle and Trundle and drop Zyra-jungle unless you're using Zyra as a support flex.\n",
  "itemization_tips": "**Build Efficiency**.\n- Vision items are items too: buy Control Wards every back and upgrade a Sweeper early (or a control trinket swap) before attempting contested objectives. The data shows vision failures \u2014 this is the cheapest, highest-ROI fix.\n- Match build to the macro role: if your intent is to contest/secure objectives, favor utility/tank items that allow you to soak damage and stay alive in the pit (Rammus/Trundle) or anti-heal and sustained burn to deny healing teams (Fiddle: Oblivion/Morello, Liandry vs tanks).\n- Avoid cookie-cutter hypercarry builds on champions whose job is control. Example mistakes likely happening: building pure single-target burst when you need zone/peel, or delaying defensive/tank stats when your team needs a pit-frontline.\n- Runes (practical guidelines):\n  - Fiddle: pick keystones that amplify pick potential (Electrocute/Dark Harvest) and secondary tree for survivability (Bone Plating/Second Wind) if you get camped.\n  - Trundle: Conqueror/Press the Attack for extended fights and duels.\n  - Rammus: Aftershock for tank engages + defensive secondaries.\n  - Lillia: Phase Rush or Conqueror depending on whether you need kiting or sustained DPS.\n  - Zyra: Electrocute/Arcane Comet for pick power if you play her as roamer.\n- Practical shopping list for objective control games: 1\u20132 Control Wards per back, early Oracle/Red trinket swap before 12:00, one Talisman/Relic upgrade as appropriate, and the defensive item that lets you survive long enough to contest pit (HP/armor/magic resist as needed).\n",
  "goals": "**Top 5 Strategic Priorities**. A ranked list of 5 concrete, actionable habits to fix the Root Cause. No fluff.\n1) Pre-objective Checklist (mandatory, every objective): 1) sweep/clear flanks with a sweeper, 2) place at least 1 control ward on a pit approach, 3) confirm enemy summoners/teleports/cooldowns, 4) ensure at least 2 allied champions are ready to fight. If any check fails, delay or force a reset. (Measure: reduce \"picked before objective\" tags from 0.875 to <0.25.)\n2) Script 3 Jungle Paths per champion and stick to them: one fast-drag path to arrive at first dragon, one gank-priority path, one counter-jungle/vision path. Practice these in the practice tool until you reliably hit objective windows (arrive 10\u201315s early). (Measure: consistent dragon/baron presence.)\n3) Role clarity per champ before champ select: write down your objective role (e.g., Fiddle = zone/ult pit; Trundle = split & tower trade; Rammus = pit initiator/peeler). If you cannot perform that role, swap champion. (Measure: KP and damage share increase toward baselines.)\n4) Vision budget rule: buy a control ward every back until mid-game vision is established; first sweeper upgrade by 9:00 on games where objectives will be contested; keep at least one control ward on you when approaching any major objective. (Measure: fewer facechecks, fewer deaths pre-objective.)\n5) Post-game micro-review: for every loss, watch the 2\u20134 minutes around the first objective conceded and timestamp the exact moment you were absent/picked. Write a 1-sentence plan to prevent that specific failure next time (where you should have been, which ward you should have placed, who to ping). Do this for 3 losses per week.\n\nHit these five in order: start with the checklist and vision budget (they are the biggest immediate gains), then lock in pathing and role clarity, and finish with post-game micro-reviews to ensure the habit sticks."
