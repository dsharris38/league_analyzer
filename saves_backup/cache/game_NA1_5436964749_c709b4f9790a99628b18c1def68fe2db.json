  "draft_analysis": "**Draft & Win Condition**\n\n- **Your comp**: Triple AP mid/jungle/enchanter (Ahri + Diana + Karma) with Ezreal poke \u2192 low front line, heavy skirmish, wants **long fights + kiting**, needs vision control and safe setups.\n- **Enemy comp**: Warwick + Riven + Neeko + Jinx + Milio \u2192 **hard engage + front-to-back teamfight + strong scaling hypercarry** with peel/cleanse from Milio.\n- **On paper edge**: Enemy. They have: reliable engage (WW + Neeko), strong side-lane threat (Riven), and a protected DPS hypercarry (Jinx + Milio) into your squishy, short-range, low-frontline comp. Your win condition is picks and tempo; theirs is 5v5 teamfights around objectives \u2013 and your deaths + lost lanes fed directly into their win condition.\n",
  "pick_quality": "**Pick Critique \u2013 Was Ahri correct?**\n\n- **Ahri vs comp**: Ahri is fine conceptually (pick + mobility vs Neeko/Jinx), but: Milio cleanses charm/CC, Warwick point-and-click suppresses you, and Riven can dive backline. You\u2019re a short-range AP with no real front line \u2013 high execution, low margin.\n- **Better options from a typical mid pool** (given your team):\n  - A **long-range control mage** (e.g. Orianna/Azir/Viktor) gives safer waveclear + better front-to-back and makes Diana\u2019s engage actually lethal.\n  - If your pool had a diver like **Sylas**: better vs Neeko/Jinx/Milio by stealing Neeko R/Milio R and scaling as a skirmish monster.\n- **New champion to learn (to cover this hole)**: **Orianna** \u2013 provides safe lane, strong objective control, and reliable 5v5 teamfight value with Diana engage, compensating for your comp\u2019s lack of front line and structure.\n",
  "story": "**The Turning Point**\n\n- **0\u201310 min**: 0/3 into Neeko by 10m (4m, 6m, 10m deaths) \u2192 she hits early mythic/levels ahead, gains prio, and can move first; your team loses mid control and thus river/objectives.\n- **First items spike** (around 15\u201317m): You complete Malignance + Sorc Shoes but are already behind; Neeko is massively ahead (12/2/7 final), so every mid- to late-game fight is started on her terms (root/ulti) while you\u2019re burstable.\n- **Mid-game fights (20\u201329m)**: Repeated deaths in side and river (21m WW, 22m Neeko, 24m Jinx, 29m Jinx) give Jinx resets and Neeko huge multi-man ults; your comp never gets controlled, vision-based picks, so enemy plays front-to-back and ends through mid.\n",
  "ideal_build": "**Objective Best Build (This Game)**\n\nAssuming standard AP Ahri vs squishy AP mid + no heavy MR stacking:\n\n- **Start**: Doran\u2019s Ring + 2 Pots.\n- **Core**:\n  - **Malignance** (mythic) \u2013 burst + ability haste + ultimate passive for picks.\n  - **Sorcerer\u2019s Shoes** \u2013 magic pen vs 4 squishies.\n- **Core damage**:\n  - **Shadowflame** \u2013 strong vs Milio shields and generally squishy targets.\n  - **Rabadon\u2019s Deathcap** \u2013 high-value AP multiplier once you have 2 items.\n- **Adaptation slots** (pick 1\u20132 depending on game state):\n  - **Banshee\u2019s Veil** \u2013 vs Neeko charm/root + Riven/WW engages; crucial when behind.\n  - **Zhonya\u2019s Hourglass** \u2013 vs Warwick R/Riven dive/Neeko R; buys time after diving or getting engaged on.\n\n**Example 6-item build**:\n- Malignance \u2192 Sorcerer\u2019s Shoes \u2192 Shadowflame \u2192 Zhonya\u2019s Hourglass \u2192 Rabadon\u2019s Deathcap \u2192 Banshee\u2019s Veil.\n",
  "build_vision": "**Build Critique \u2013 What went wrong & why the ideal is better**\n\n- **What you built**:\n  - Malignance \u2192 Sorcerer\u2019s Shoes \u2192 started **Lich Bane** \u2192 Needlessly Large Rod (likely toward Deathcap) \u2013 no defensive item completed by 29m.\n- **Issues**:\n  - **Lich Bane**: too greedy. Requires you to walk into short AA range vs Warwick R, Riven gap-close, Neeko root/R, and Jinx DPS. You\u2019re already 0/3 early; committing to an on-hit burst build massively increases risk with no front line.\n  - No **Zhonya\u2019s** or **Banshee\u2019s**: against Neeko (12/2), Warwick, and Riven, you need a stasis or spell shield to survive first contact. You died repeatedly in mid/river because any catch = instant death.\n- **Why ideal build is better here**:\n  - **Shadowflame + pen boots** maximize damage from safe Q/E range vs shielded targets (Milio) without needing to walk in to auto.\n  - **Zhonya\u2019s/Banshee\u2019s** let you actually play fights: you can fish for charms or follow Diana engages, survive initial CC/ult combo, then re-enter with R resets instead of being one-shot on engage.\n",
  "mistakes": "**Critical Mistakes & Bad Habits**\n\n1. **What specifically lost THIS game**\n- **Early laning deaths vs Neeko (4m, 6m, 10m)**:\n  - Likely walking up for CS without respecting her E+Q+passive root/clone, or wave states that left you gankable. This gave Neeko lane control, XP lead, and roam timers.\n- **No defensive pivot while behind**:\n  - At 0/3 then 2/5, you still rushed Lich Bane instead of Zhonya\u2019s/Banshee\u2019s. You became free gold for WW/Riven/Neeko in every skirmish.\n- **Mid/river positioning after outer towers fell**:\n  - Repeated deaths at 21\u201324\u201329m show you contesting vision or waves without info on WW/Neeko/Jinx; your comp needs **fog control + pick**, not face-up 5v5s when behind.\n\n2. **Silent Killer habits (will hurt future games)**\n- **Too much coin-flip trading when behind**:\n  - After first death to Neeko, you need to thin waves under tower, play for XP, and call jungle to break push \u2013 not handshake trades vs fed burst mage with CC.\n- **Ignoring enemy hard engage ranges**:\n  - Warwick R range and Neeko E+R range must be treated like \u2018no-cross\u2019 zones if you don\u2019t have vision or stasis. Walking into river/side-lanes without tracking these tools is a long-term losing pattern.\n- **Itemization not matching game state**:\n  - Building damage when behind (Dark Seal early into 0/3, Lich Bane vs heavy engage) instead of stabilizing with survivability. Learning to pivot items based on *state*, not just champion, will massively increase consistency.\n",
  "verdict": "**Final Verdict**\n\n- You lost because Neeko snowballed hard off early mid deaths and you doubled down on a greedy, short-range damage build instead of pivoting to safe waveclear, vision-based picks, and defensive items to survive their engage-heavy, front-to-back comp."
