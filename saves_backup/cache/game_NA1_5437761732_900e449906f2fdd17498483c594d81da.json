  "draft_analysis": "**Draft & Win Condition**\n\n- **Your comp**: 3 AD divers/skirmishers (Riven, Jayce, Twitch) + 2 fragile picks (AP Kai'Sa, Shaco). Very high damage, low front line, low reliability in 5v5; best as **pick / flank / side lane** comp.\n- **Enemy comp**: Aurelion Sol + Vladimir + Amumu + Jhin + Blitz = **hard scaling teamfight wombo** (AoE CC, AoE damage, strong backline, double AP threats).\n- **On paper edge**: Enemy. If game goes past ~25 minutes and they group, their comp massively outperforms yours in front\u2011to\u2011back fights. Your win condition is: snowball early through sides, deny Aurelion Sol tempo, and force skirmishes around vision instead of grouped 5v5s.",
  "pick_quality": "**Pick Critique**\n\n- **Riven viability**: Riven mid/top is fine into double AP (Vlad + Aurelion Sol) if you abuse early levels and create side\u2011lane pressure; but with no true tank and double ADC, your comp becomes 4 squishy damage dealers + Shaco, which is very volatile into Amumu + Blitz.\n- **Better from typical fighter/assassin pool**: If you have something like **Sylas** or **Irelia** in your pool, they bring similar skirmish power but scale better into teamfights vs AP + wombo comps (Sylas especially loves stealing Amumu/Vlad/Aurelion Sol ults).\n- **New champ to add**: Learn **Nautilus** (mid/top support flex). He gives you: hard engage, peel vs Blitz/Amumu/Aurelion Sol, and an actual front line so your Twitch/Kai'Sa can DPS in later fights.",
  "story": "**The Turning Point**\n\n- **Mid\u2011game shift (~20\u201328 min)**: You took outer/inner towers top and mid, but then repeatedly died to Aurelion Sol (25m, 28m, 33m, 35m). Each death bought him time to scale, stack his passive, and control mid waves.\n- **Base race / map collapse**: While you were trading kills and structures, they won the crucial **mid inhibitor + nexus turret sequences** off Aurelion Sol\u2011centered teamfights (Amumu engage + Aurelion Sol follow). Your comp couldn\u2019t play front\u2011to\u2011back into that once behind in tempo.\n- **End state**: Your side\u2011lane pressure didn\u2019t convert into vision control or objective setups; their scaling teamfight comp got to group mid and end through repeated picks and won 5v5s.",
  "ideal_build": "**Objective Best Build (This Game)**\n\n- **Start**: Doran's Blade + 1 pot (you want lane prio/kill threat, not Shield, into AP skillshot/DoT champs you can all\u2011in).\n- **Core** (mid Riven meta + vs double AP + Vlad heal):\n  - Ionian Boots of Lucidity\n  - **Axiom Arc** (core mid\u2011Riven for ult uptime and snowball potential)\n  - **Sundered Sky** (main mythic for sustain, HP, and extended fight DPS)\n  - **Maw of Malmortius** (3rd/4th vs Vlad + Aurelion Sol burst)\n  - **Serpent's Fang** or **Chempunk Chainsword** depending on shields vs healing (here: more value from anti\u2011heal \u2192 **Chempunk**, or finishing **Mortal Reminder** later)\n  - **Guardian Angel / Death\u2019s Dance** as last slot depending on who\u2019s fed (GA vs Aurelion/Jhin burst, DD for extended skirmish vs mixed damage)\n- **Situational swaps**:\n  - If Amumu/Blitz hooks and hard CC are deciding fights: **Mercury's Treads** are correct.\n  - If front line becomes an issue: consider **Black Cleaver** 3rd/4th instead of pure damage to shred Amumu and front\u2011to\u2011back with Twitch.",
  "build_vision": "**Build Critique (Your Build vs Ideal)**\n\n- **What you built**: Maw \u2192 Merc Treads \u2192 Ravenous Hydra \u2192 Death\u2019s Dance \u2192 Mortal Reminder.\n  - Positives: Early Hexdrinker\u2192Maw vs Vlad/Aurelion is good; Mercs into Amumu/Blitz reasonable; anti\u2011heal (Mortal Reminder) is correct conceptually.\n  - Issues: No **mythic at all**, no **Axiom Arc**, and delayed your **CDR/damage spike** by rushing Maw + Hydra + DD.\n- **Why ideal is better here**:\n  - **Axiom Arc**: huge for repeatedly ulting in skirmishes and quickly cycling ult in fights vs a scaling comp \u2013 gives you actual burst windows to delete Aurelion/Jhin.\n  - **Sundered Sky**: HP + sustain + damage makes you far tankier vs Amumu/Aurelion\u2019s AoE while still one\u2011shotting squishies; much better front\u2011to\u2011back than early Hydra.\n  - **Hydra timing**: Hydra 2nd is greed; it adds waveclear you don\u2019t strictly need while delaying tankiness/CDR and your primary damage mythic. It also encourages perma\u2011side\u2011lane when your team needs you for coordinated fights.\n  - **Double early defense (Maw + DD)**: Over\u2011indexes on survivability without enough raw threat or ability haste, making it harder to actually kill Aurelion/Jhin before they get peel/CC off.",
  "mistakes": "**Critical Mistakes & Bad Habits**\n\n- **What lost THIS game**:\n  - **Overstaying/coin\u2011flip fights vs Aurelion Sol after taking towers**: Multiple deaths at 25m, 28m, 33m, 35m handed their main carry gold + time to scale, instead of you resetting, controlling vision, and forcing picks on side.\n  - **No mythic / late spike**: Skipping core mid\u2011Riven mythics meant you never hit a strong, clean 2\u2011item timing; mid\u2011game you were durable but not threatening enough to reliably delete enemy carries in one rotation.\n  - **Wrong fight selection**: Your comp wants flanks and numbers advantages; you kept fighting into their grouped 5v5 (Amumu + Aurelion Sol + Jhin) where their comp is designed to win.\n\n- **Silent killers (will hurt your climb long\u2011term)**:\n  - **Defensive early start (Doran\u2019s Shield) on a snowball champ**: You gave up lane pressure in a game where your job is to accelerate tempo before scaling kicks in.\n  - **Poor gold efficiency / component clutter**: Many Long Swords, late mythic, and tier\u20112/3 items led to messy power curves. Getting to clear 2\u2011item spikes (mythic + 1 legendary) fast is more important than stacking random AD.\n  - **Side\u2011lane without setup**: Pushing side without deep vision or tracking enemy mid/jungle leads to repeat deaths; you must only pressure side when you know where Aurelion/Amumu are and your team can pressure opposite side or mid wave.",
  "verdict": "**Final Verdict**\n\n- You had the right champion archetype for snowballing, but inefficient itemization plus repeated mid\u2011late deaths to Aurelion Sol and grouped 5v5s into a superior teamfight comp prevented your early side\u2011lane pressure from converting into a win."
