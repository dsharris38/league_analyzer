  "overview": "Markdown. **The Diagnosis**.\n\n1. **Your Archetype**: The Isolated Duelist.\n   - You primarily pick skirmish/duel champions (Yone, Riven, occasional Jax) and some burst mages (Ahri, Syndra). Your numbers show a player who often seeks 1v1/2v2 fights and side pressure: good CS/min near high-level baseline, above-baseline KDA overall, but low team involvement (avg KP 0.40 vs 0.65 baseline) and repeated objective losses. In short \u2014 you win or lose by your personal skirmishes rather than by controlling the map with your team.\n\n2. **The Root Cause**: A combination of identity mismatch + macro discipline failures.\n   - Symptom: Low kill participation, repeated \"got picked before objective,\" and objective/control gaps (dragon/baron/towers).\n   - Why: You habitually play like a duelist who tries to create advantages by winning side fights or roaming solo, but you (a) don\u2019t time those fights to objective windows, (b) miss or neglect vision/engage coordination, and (c) get isolated and punished before team objectives. When you lane well individually you don\u2019t translate that into objective control or teamfights; when you try to force skirmishes you often overextend and get picked. The result: good micro (1v1) but poor macro and poor team integration.\n\n3. **The 'One Big Thing'**: Stop playing isolated skirmishes that don't convert into objective control. Make your personal fights either (A) prepare and secure an objective (vision + teammates nearby) or (B) be a committed, timely side-lane that draws pressure and enables your team to take towers/dragons \u2014 not a solo threat that dies before fights start.\n",
  "champion_feedback": "Markdown. **Champion-Specific Adjustments**.\n\nYone (Primary):\n- Shift identity: Stop YOLOing into isolated skirmishes. Play Yone as a pressure engine that forces enemy response and creates windows for dragons/baron. \n- Lane: Prioritize wave-management (fast shove -> recall) or slow push to set up side pressure. If you push deep, place deep vision and ping before you commit. \n- Mid game: Use your ult for picks only when the enemy is out of vision or when your team is ready to follow. Avoid flanking into visionless objective fights. \n- Defensive tweaks: Consider one defensive/utility item earlier (Maw/Death's Dance/GA) when enemy has heavy instant-engage or AP burst.\n\nAhri (Most efficient pick):\n- Identity: Teamfight roamer and pick-maker \u2014 this fits your winrate and KP. Emphasize roaming to side lanes and creating picks before objective fights. \n- Lane: Use charm to secure deep wards/roams; shove and roam mid-7\u201310 minute windows. \n- Teamfights: Play as front-middle peel/pick tool rather than an isolated assassin.\n\nRiven (Top/side champion):\n- Identity: If you play Riven, treat her as a top/side split threat. Mid Riven games show mixed responsibility \u2014 consider moving Riven to top or account for team comp. \n- Macro: If you split, ensure your team can threaten objectives while you draw pressure. If your team cannot, avoid pure split; instead look for coordinated engages.\n\nSyndra / Leblanc / Viktor (Occasional picks):\n- Syndra & Leblanc: Use as pick tools \u2014 target roams and skirmishes where your team can collapse. Avoid blind flanks into objectives where you'll be the first death. \n- Viktor: Safe scaler \u2014 prioritize surviving to mid-game and controlling zones in teamfights; if you pick Viktor, play to protect neutral objectives (poke, control zones, don\u2019t chase isolated fights).\n\nGeneral pool guidance:\n- Prioritize Ahri when you want reliable objective impact and higher KP. Yone is fine if you commit to macro adaptation (vision + timing). Deprioritize mid Akali/Akali-like risky solo assassins in solo queue unless you are confident your team will follow picks.\n",
  "itemization_tips": "Markdown. **Build Efficiency**.\n\n- Defensive options matter: On Yone and other melee skirmishers, you take a lot of damage and get picked. Shift one item slot earlier to defensive/utility (Death's Dance, Sterak's/GA, or Maw vs heavy AP) situationally instead of straight glass cannon. This reduces \"got picked before objective\" and high-death losses.\n\n- Stopwatch/Control: Buy a Stopwatch / Guardian Angel more often into games where your team contests Baron/Dragon heavily. Many losses come from getting picked at objectives \u2014 Stopwatch wins fights and denies picks.\n\n- Rune alignment: Play runes that match your macro intent. For Yone, Conqueror + Resolve secondary (second wind/overgrowth) when you need sustain and to survive skirmishes; for Ahri, Electrocute or Aery depending on playstyle (Electrocute if you want pick burst and roams). Avoid purely aggressive rune pages when your strength is forcing objectives.\n\n- Vision kit: Spend early gold on Control Wards and buy Sweeper consistently before major objective windows. Your losses show repeated lack of vision and being caught \u2014 the cheapest and highest-ROI item change is better warding and an earlier Oracle Lens upgrade.\n\n- Item spikes & timing: Be explicit about when you can force objectives \u2014 know your 1/2-item power spike (Yone 2-item, Ahri level 9\u201311 roam windows) and only force fights/objectives within those windows with appropriate vision.\n",
  "goals": "Markdown. **Top 5 Strategic Priorities**. A ranked list of 5 concrete, actionable habits to fix the Root Cause. No fluff.\n\n1) Objective-First Vision Routine (daily habit): Before every neutral objective (dragon/baron) commit to placing 2+ vision items: a Control Ward in the river/entry and an active Oracle lens on a timer. If you cannot get these, do not be the first engager \u2014 ping and wait for teammates.\n\n2) KPI: Raise Kill Participation to 0.55 within 6 weeks: Force it by either roaming with TP/roam windows (Ahri) or by grouping with team when the objective is live. Track KP each session and stop playing side fights unless you have 2+ teammates or vision to back you.\n\n3) Positional discipline at objectives (in-game checklist): 1) Are my wards covering flank? 2) Do I have ult/escape/stopwatch? 3) Is my team in position to follow? If any are no -> do not deep-flank. This will reduce \"got picked before objective\" events.\n\n4) Champion-pool constraint: For the next 50 ranked games, prioritize Ahri + 1 skirmisher (Yone) only. Goal: 70% of games on these two to stabilize decision patterns. Avoid swapping to off-meta/unstable picks mid-session (Akali, random top-lane champs in mid).\n\n5) 2-minute farming sprint & wave control: Add a 2\u20133 minute warmup in normals or the first 3 minutes of queue to practice hitting 7.5+ CS/min baseline. While farming, practice quick waveshoves and recall timing so your power spikes line up with objective windows (return to map with Control Ward and TP/roam readiness).\n\nExecute these five priorities in order: vision + objective discipline first, then KP & champion pool, then farming discipline. That sequence will convert your skirmishes into team wins instead of costly picks."
