  "draft_analysis": "**Draft & Win Condition**\n\n- Your comp: front-to-back dive-pick (Leona + Lillia engage, Yone follow, Jhin cleanup). Strong 5v5 if you **go first** and control vision.\n- Enemy comp: scaling AP solo lanes + hard wombo (Amumu + Vlad + Gwen, with Cait follow-up). Lots of AoE, mixed damage, and outscaling.\n- On paper edge: Enemy. Triple scaling threats + Amumu engage + outscaled top/mid. Your win condition is **mid-game tempo**: secure early dragons, deny Vlad/Gwen sidelane, and fight on vision before Amumu/Vlad get multi-man ults.",
  "pick_quality": "**Pick Critique (Yone Mid)**\n\n- Into Vladimir + Gwen + Amumu, Yone is risky: short range, forced to dive into 3 AoE damage champs with CC, and current-meta Yone is only C-tier (47.25% WR).\n- Your team already had engage (Leona, Lillia); what you lacked was **safe mid-range DPS or control mage** to punish Vlad early and play front-to-back.\n- If your pool lacks this type, add **Orianna**: safe lane vs Vlad, strong control in mid-game fights, scales well, and synergizes hard with Lillia/Leona engage.",
  "story": "**The Turning Point**\n\n- 13\u201323 minutes: you repeatedly died around river/mid (13m, 14m, 15m, 19m, 22m, 23m) while outer towers fell top/mid \u2192 enemy got **map control + sidelane pressure** far too early.\n- These deaths happened **before core lifesteal + resistances** were online; diving into Amumu/Vlad without vision turned every skirmish into a losing fight, accelerating Vlad/Gwen scaling.\n- By ~22m your mid nexus turret was already gone: from that point, even good picks (30m triple kill chain vs Vlad+Gwen) couldn\u2019t stabilize because your base was permanently exposed and fights were on their vision.",
  "ideal_build": "**Objective Best Build (This Game)**\n\nBaseline from meta (Press the Attack Yone mid) adapted for double AP solo lanes + Vladimir sustain:\n\n- Mythic/Core:\n  - **Berserker's Greaves**\n  - **Blade of the Ruined King** (vs Gwen + Amumu front line and HP stacking)\n  - **Immortal Shieldbow** (survivability vs Amumu/Vlad burst and Cait traps)\n- Mid/Late Items (vs heavy AP + healing):\n  - **Wit's End** (early MR + on-hit DPS vs Vlad/Gwen/Amumu)\n  - **Mortal Reminder** (upgraded early Executioner to cut Vlad/Gwen healing)\n  - **Spirit Visage** *or* **Randuin's Omen** depending on threat: \n    - Spirit Visage if Vlad/Gwen one-shot / to enhance Shieldbow + lifesteal\n    - Randuin\u2019s if Cait crit becomes primary late-game threat\n\nFinal 6-slot example (this game leans AP-heavy):\n- Berserker's Greaves\n- Blade of the Ruined King\n- Immortal Shieldbow\n- Wit's End\n- Mortal Reminder\n- Spirit Visage",
  "build_vision": "**Build Critique**\n\n- Positives:\n  - You followed the meta **core trio**: Berserker's \u2192 BORK \u2192 Shieldbow, and correctly picked up **Executioner \u2192 Mortal Reminder** vs Vlad/Gwen.\n  - You recognized the AP threat and bought **Wit's End** and **Spectre\u2019s Cowl** (MR, sustain).\n\n- Issues:\n  - **Extremely delayed mythic**: Shieldbow finished at **28m**; until then you were fighting Vlad/Gwen without your main survivability spike. You rushed BORK + full Wit's End **before** mythic, which made mid-game dives much riskier.\n  - **Gold waste / odd sequencing**: triple Recurve Bow purchase at 13\u201320m and duplicated Shieldbow/Mortal Reminder buys in the log suggest inefficient backs or over-buying components instead of finishing a key item earlier.\n  - **MR slot not fully optimized**: You ended with **Spectre\u2019s Cowl** still unfinished. Upgrading earlier into **Spirit Visage** would have massively increased sustain with Shieldbow + lifesteal and made front-to-back fights more stable.\n\n- Ideal adjustment:\n  - Boots \u2192 **BORK** \u2192 **Shieldbow** earlier (aim before 20\u201322m) \u2192 **Wit's End** as 3rd/4th \u2192 **Mortal Reminder** \u2192 **Spirit Visage**. This keeps you online during the crucial 15\u201325m window where your comp must win skirmishes.",
  "mistakes": "**Critical Mistakes & Bad Habits**\n\n1) What lost THIS game\n- **Mid-game overfighting without item spikes**: Repeated deaths 13\u201323m while still on components and without mythic gave Vlad/Gwen free scaling and opened your mid/top base turrets absurdly early.\n- **Fighting into their engage on low vision**: Dying to Amumu/Vlad repeatedly in river/jungle indicates you were often the one facechecking or stepping up first, instead of letting Leona/Lillia start.\n- **Side pressure not respected**: Gwen/Vlad were allowed to push deep (top inhib pressure at 20m, nexus turret at 22m). As Yone, you must either **answer sidelane with TP/rotation** or force decisive 5v5s on your terms.\n\n2) Silent killers for your climb\n- **Back timings & component spam**: Buying multiple Recurve Bows and delaying mythic shows a habit of spending gold as soon as you have it, rather than planning for **key power spikes**. This lowers your impact in every crucial fight.\n- **Engaging as a primary diver vs triple AoE**: Yone should be **second wave**\u2014wait for Amumu/Braum/Vlad ults to be used or for Leona/Lillia to start, then R onto carries. Going first into Amumu+Vlad is a guaranteed way to lose fights as you climb.\n- **Wave management vs scaling mages**: Early Dorans Shield + ultra-fast Berserkers suggests you may have been trading/short fighting instead of hard pushing/cross-mapping vs Vlad. Against Vlad you want **push\u2013move**, not extended all-ins pre-6/first item.",
  "verdict": "**Final Verdict**\n\n- The game was lost because your mid-game item spikes and vision control came too late; repeated deaths while under-itemized vs a heavy scaling Amumu\u2013Vlad\u2013Gwen comp gave them map control and outscaling before Yone\u2019s pressure could matter."
