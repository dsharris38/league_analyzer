  "overview": "**The Diagnosis**.\n\n1. **Your Archetype**: \"The Duelist with a Map Blindspot\". You are a mid\u2011lane skirmisher/assassin type (Yone/Riven/Akali tendencies) who can win isolated fights and keep an above\u2011baseline KDA, but you frequently play like a solo duelist instead of a team pivot. Your damage share and CS are near high\u2011elo baselines, KDA is healthy, but your kill participation, vision, and objective influence are consistently low \u2014 so your personal wins don't convert into team wins.\n\n2. **The Root Cause**: You treat lane and fights as isolated mechanical contests rather than as coordinated objective windows. That shows up three ways: (A) low kill participation \u2014 you either stay top-of-wave, take risky 1v1s that don\u2019t lead to objectives, or you arrive late to fights; (B) poor vision and timing \u2014 multiple 'picked before objective' flags show you and your team are getting collapsed because vision and approach are sloppy; (C) identity mismatch \u2014 you play champions that demand either side\u2011pressure or coordinated map movement, but you don\u2019t consistently shift your role to create/secure dragons/barons/towers. The symptom is losing towers/dragons/barons; the cause is decision discipline and map\u2011aware role execution.\n\n3. **The 'One Big Thing'**: Stop treating fights as the primary goal \u2014 make objectives the endpoint of your fights. Concretely: increase your kill participation around objective windows by improving pre\u2011objective vision clearing, timing your roams/recalls, and choosing team\u2011safe engagements so your presence (alive and contributing) arrives before the objective starts. If your presence at the objective is consistent, nearly every other macro issue (tower/dragon/baron gaps, low damage share) starts to resolve.\n\n",
  "champion_feedback": "**Champion-Specific Adjustments**. Use these identity shifts and phase coaching for your most-played picks. Each section focuses on how to convert individual power into objective impact.\n\n### Yone\nIdentity shift: from \"solo brawler\" to \"fast tempo skirmisher who converts side pressure into objectives.\" Lane: play safer early \u2014 don't take 1v1 all\u2011ins unless it leads to an immediate objective or turret plate. Wave: learn a 20\u201335s window to shove and roam/TP for dragon or mid jungle resets. Mid game: your power spikes matter only if you show up alive to fights \u2014 prioritize flank angles that let you join post\u2011CC, not first\u2011in suicide dives. Late game: split when your team can threaten an objective or when the enemy must respond; otherwise group for baron fights.\n\n### Ahri\nIdentity shift: from roaming pick machine to reliable team fight opener and objective control facilitator. Lane: keep push+roam windows timed to dragon spawn (shove two waves then roam). Mid game: use charm more as a tool to secure picks before objectives; if you get one person and the enemy backs, convert that to dragon/tower. Late game: buy one safety item (Zhonya/Stopwatch) when opponent has single\u2011target burst/picks so you're not the \"picked before objective\" casualty.\n\n### Riven (and other top/skirmishers you play mid occasionally)\nIdentity shift: respect the map role \u2014 when in mid or top, your split threat must create either a numerical advantage or force a trade for an objective. Lane: if you're top, ping for your mid/jungle when you\u2019re 2\u2011item and ready to force enemy rotations. Mid game: don't chase isolated kills far from objective timers. Late game: your 1v1 is valuable only if it removes a defender or draws a response; practice quick shove/push to create baron windows.\n\n### Viktor / Syndra / Lissandra\nIdentity shift: scale into zone control and reliable teamfight contribution instead of desperate all\u2011ins. Lane: prioritize safe CS and level/timing windows so you can control river vision. Mid game: use your zone/ult to deny enemy vision and force fights on your terms around dragons. Late game: play as a peel/zone anchor (Viktor/Syndra) or as a last\u2011resort engage/protect (Lissandra) \u2014 avoid being the first to die.\n\n### Akali / Zed / Kassadin (assassins)\nIdentity shift: convert roams/picks into objective windows rather than chasing kills for score. Lane: shove and roam when the enemy resets or dies; announce your intent (pings). Mid/Late: target backline only when your team is committed to the objective; avoid soloblasting into vision where you get collapsed before baron/dragon.\n\n",
  "itemization_tips": "**Build Efficiency**. High\u2011level, common errors implied by the data and how to fix them.\n\n- You are getting picked before objectives and dying in fights \u2014 start taking a Stopwatch in your boot slot or as a component on at least ~20\u201330% of games on Yone/Akali/Ahri versus heavy pick comps. A single Zhonya/Stopwatch reduces 'picked before objective' rate dramatically.\n- Control wards and upgrade trinket discipline: buy at least one control ward every back from 6min onward and keep Oracle/Control\u2011clearing priority before any dragon/baron. Your avg vision score (~23) is low for someone who needs to avoid picks.\n- Adaptive defensive buys over greedy glass\u2011cannon: when you or your team lacks peel, convert one damage item into survivability (Mercs/Null\u2011Magic/GA/Zhonya) depending on threat. This prevents high\u2011value deaths that cost objectives.\n- Runes: for duelists (Yone/Riven) favor press\u2011the\u2011attack/Conqueror only when you can reliably extend trades into objectives \u2014 otherwise run Fleet/Resolve hybrid or take Bone\u2011Plating if laning vs heavy poke. For Ahri/Viktor/Syndra prefer Electrocute or Phase Rush depending on playstyle, but prioritize Presence of Mind/Absolute Focus/Scorch only if it helps objective windows (mana sustain and roaming power).\n- Item timing: on waveclear mages (Viktor/Syndra), delay luxury items to get one objective\u2011securing item earlier (e.g., Zhonya/Morello/Oblivion slot) so you can contest dragon without dying immediately.\n\n",
  "goals": "**Top 5 Strategic Priorities**. Ranked, specific, actionable habits to fix the Root Cause. No fluff.\n\n1) Objective\u2011first kill participation (KP windows): For the next 20 games, commit to being within 1200 units of any objective 90 seconds before spawn or immediately after a reset. If you can't be there, shove and ping to force the enemy to choose \u2014 never be AFK on the opposite side of the map when an objective starts.\n\n2) Vision ritual: buy a control ward on your first back and every time you return with 300+ gold; use Oracle or Sweep before any attempt at dragon/baron. Make clearing the enemy control ward and placing 1 control ward a hard habit before an objective fight.\n\n3) One defensive purchase rule: whenever enemy comp has >1 reliable pick/one\u2011shot tool, take Stopwatch or Zhonya on the first full build cycle (before finishing that 3rd offensive item). Track this as a binary pass/fail after each loss.\n\n4) Kill Participation metric: raise your KP from ~40% to 55\u201360% within 6 weeks by: (a) roaming on shoved waves to help jungle for early dragons, (b) grouping 10\u201320s earlier for mid game objectives, (c) pinging and following up \u2014 not soloing. Log KP after each session and stop playing a champion that consistently keeps KP <50%.\n\n5) Pocket\u20113 champion plan & phase scripts: reduce your pool to 3 mid champions (one skirmisher \u2014 Yone or Riven if you insist, one reliable roam/pick \u2014 Ahri, and one scaling zone control \u2014 Viktor/Syndra). For each champion write a 3\u2011line script (Lane: shove/roam cooldowns; Mid: objective role; Late: positioning role). Practice those scripts in normal games until they are automatic.\n\n"
